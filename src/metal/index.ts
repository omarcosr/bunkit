// Metal: typed GPU programming, and a 3D scene built on it.
//
//   import { gpu, struct, vec4f, mat4x4f, msl, GPUView } from "@omarcosr/bunkit/metal";
//
// Three layers, same as the rest of BunKit. `Scene3D` is the easy one: nodes,
// a camera, a light. `GPUView` is the surface plus a frame loop, and you write
// the passes. `gpu()` is the device, and everything it hands out — buffers,
// shaders, pipelines, textures — carries `.native` for raw Objective-C.
